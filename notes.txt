Middleware are the building blocks of express
to be consumed by web applications
-ember -angular -jquery

rich javascript applications allow for a
more interactive experience on the web

So that when there is a request not the whole
page is reloaded


We can serve a file by sending it as a response
on a get route
or
using static middleware

serving static files from the public folder
app.use(express.static('public'));


Understand middleware
middleware are functions added to the stack that
have access to request and response objects that
are executed sequentially.

A request or response passes through each layer of
middleware until they get to one endpoint of the
architechture (server-client)

next() function
is called to move to the next middleware.

a send function will finish the middleware

pipeline

the source code from static lacks semicolons
