Middleware are the building blocks of express
to be consumed by web applications
-ember -angular -jquery

rich javascript applications allow for a
more interactive experience on the web

So that when there is a request not the whole
page is reloaded


We can serve a file by sending it as a response
on a get route
or
using static middleware

serving static files from the public folder
app.use(express.static('public'));


Understand middleware
middleware are functions added to the stack that
have access to request and response objects that
are executed sequentially.

A request or response passes through each layer of
middleware until they get to one endpoint of the
architechture (server-client)

next() function
is called to move to the next middleware.

a send function will finish the middleware

pipeline

the source code from static lacks semicolons

Static middleware serves everything under the
specified folder, in this case, public
That's why the image is also there :D

We're serving static files, like index.html
and the picture.


to use middleware,
app.use();


express-static is the only middleware already shipped with express 4
